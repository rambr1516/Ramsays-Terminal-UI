# Ramsays-Terminal-UI
Me. Save. Good. Terminal. UI. Useful. For. Daily. Server. Tasks. For Linux or Mac usually
also I like [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) so these should mostly be brew or docker things.

#### [BTOP](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) - btop on top 
- as the best visual glance 'task manager' pretty, easy to use and customize, and able to be run with sudo to end everything at will, and mouse support if you are in the terminal and don't like keyboards

#### [LazyDocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) - very sexy Docker Container UI
- easy to use, mouse support, shows everything, bulk commands, easy stop start restart of anything you'd like, docker style

#### [Superfile](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile?tab=readme-ov-file#plugins)
- holy shit this TUI is beautiful, quick, and powerful - easy access to favorite folders, drives, amazing [wiki](https://superfile.dev/getting-started/installation/) - hotkeys, themes, pins, clipboard, 'copy while moving around', .file visuals, metadata, process view, quick code and plaintext quick view, (low quality) image quick view? What the fuck else could you want? 
- special shoutout to [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/) - I would say its a bit more stable and has less quirks

#### [Diskonaut](https://github.com/imsnif/diskonaut)
- amazing storage tool, works like any visual tree/map of your drive, and lets you dig into folders to find out what is taking too much space! You can explore even while scanning so its not a big deal if a scan takes a long time. Delete folders right in the UI, or just dig deep into your file structure.
